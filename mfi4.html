          <p>This website is a little jump course game where you add i's to your phrase by surviving. It's done with a simple style, looking mostly like text. Hitting other letters gives you powerups with different effects.</p>

          <h3><a href="http://tholman.com/texter/">Text Art</a></h3>
          <p>This website lets you create art with type. You can choose what type gets put out, what color it is, what the background looks like, and so on. However, I have noticed one flaw, and that is when I resize my window, it wipes all my progress. I'm not sure if this is exclusive to me or if it is from certain browsers.</p>
