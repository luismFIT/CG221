        <h3><a href="http://www.selfcontrolfreak.com/slaan.html">Slaan/selfcontrolfreak</a></h3>
          <p>A page built around an Adobe Flash where there is a man waiting on a desk. If you bring your cursor near his face, he will smack it away. This will actually move the cursor.</p>
      </li>

          <h3><a href="http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html">Solar System</a></h3>
        <p>If the moon was only a pixel, this is what our solar system would look like. It is really far across horizontally, but is displayed like a giant chart. You can also change the unit of distance in the center near the bottom. Space really is just mostly made up of space.</p>
