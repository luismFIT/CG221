    <p>Fun interact-able websites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/40.62,-73.99/12">Flight Radar</a></h3>
          <p>This website lets you go around Google maps, but it also shows you Live Air Traffic, just like a traffic controller would see. You can click on a flight to learn where its statistics, such as its destination, where it came from, how high it is, what company it belongs to, and more. Not every flight is a commercial passenger flight, some are private or belong to organizations like flight schools.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://neave.com/swarm/">Swarm</a></h3>
        <p>"An interactive mouse toy." These weird things that resemble bugs pop up and crawl around on your screen. Or maybe they're like tadpoles swimming around. Some of them will group together and chase your cursor. When you click the screen the colors invert.</p>
