    <h1>Save the Water</h1>
    <h2>Why should you care?</h2>
    <p>
      Water is one of the most important substances for preserving and maintaining life. Whenever a scientist looks to other planets to see evidence of life there, they look for water. However, in developed nations we tend to take the abundance of clean water for granted because we can call just get it out of the tap any time we wish. But we are actually depleting the global supply of fresh water, and if we don't change our habits just a little, we could have major consequences. This website was made to show just a few ways you can help out.
