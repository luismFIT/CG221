          <p>This website is a game where you play as a nation and capture tiles in real time against other players. Most of the action can be controlled using the mouse, and even though the game may seem simple there is some depth to it. A player clicks on things to perform various actions, such as capturing tiles or building towers. But if another player sees them doing so near a tile they own, they can stop it by clicking on it. The site includes a nice tutorial that explains the details of the game pretty well, in addition to some other pages that provide quick explanations as to controls and what the icons in the game mean. </p>

          <p>This website allows visitors to make music together online. Using the mouse, clicking along the chords allow for high notes or low notes to be played, and the different colors on the right affect what sort sound you make. Many combinations of colors sound great! I prefer to sparingly click instead of holding it down.</p>
