      <p>I'm an FIT student from Brooklyn, NY who is aiming to get into the Computer Animation program. I am currently in the Communication Design program. I aim to flesh out this website more throughout the course with pictures and other techniques we learn in the class. I have taken HTML and Java courses in High School, but I hope to use the things we learn in this course to create new, beter, and more interactive websites.</p>
