    <p>Artwork that I think it would be cook to interact with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          <h2>The Scream</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/The_Scream.jpg" alt="screamingguy">
          <p>If a user were able to interact with this painting, I would have it scream whenever the mouse cursor hovered over it. It would be cool if there were different screams each time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h2>Painting</h2>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>Filler text</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
