    <p>Artwork that I think it would be cook to interact with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          <h2>The Scream</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/The_Scream.jpg" alt="screamingguy">
          <p>If a user were able to interact with this painting, I would have it scream whenever the mouse cursor hovered over it. It would be cool if there were different screams each time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h2>Broadway Boogie-Woogie</h2>
          <img src="https://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMzU0MCJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=52bcb4c10cb106be" alt="broadway">
        <p>This image would be great if a whole page would be designed around it. I imagine all the squares moving around on the yellow lanes and changing colors. Perhaps the bigger colored squares could be links to other pages.</p>
      </li>
